# XPPython3 Installation Notes

See https://xppython3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/installation_plugin.html
Seriously, it's all there.

# Errors
If you have errors running python plugins,
1. Check `Log.txt`. Make sure python and the python plugin are installed correctly. If not,
   there will be a message in Log.txt, and XPPython3Log.txt will not be created. Verify it's Python3, not Python2
   getting loaded.
2. Check `XPPython3Log.txt`. Most python coding errors / exceptions will be reported in this
   log.

You must provide both Log.txt and XPPython3.log when looking for assistance with a python plugin.

But, seriously, check the on-line documentation.
