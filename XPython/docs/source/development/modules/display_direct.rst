Direct Drawing
==============

.. py:module:: XPLMDisplay
   :no-index:
.. py:currentmodule:: xp      

Basic drawing callbacks are for low level intercepting of render loop. The
purpose of drawing callbacks is to provide targeted additions or
replacements to x-plane's graphics environment (for example, to add extra
custom objects, or replace drawing of the AI aircraft).  Do not assume that
the drawing callbacks will be called in the order implied by the
enumerations. Also do not assume that each drawing phase ends before
another begins; they may be nested.

.. note:: Laminar says, "Note that all APIs in this section are deprecated, and
          will likely be removed during the X-Plane 11 run as part of the
          transition to Vulkan/Metal/etc. See :mod:`XPLMInstance` API for
          future-proof drawing of 3-D objects.

Register and Unregister your drawing callback(s). You may register a callback multiple times for
the same or different phases as long as the reference constant is unique for each registration.

.. py:function:: registerDrawCallback(draw, phase=Phase_Window, after=1, refCon=None)
 
  Register a low level drawing callback.

  *phase* indicates where in the drawing phase you wish to be called, with *after* indicating
  if you want to be called before (0), or after(1) the indicated phase. The *refCon* will
  be passed to your *draw* callback function. (See below for valid phases.)
 
  On success, 1 is returned, 0 otherwise.
 
  You may register a callback multiple times for the same or different
  phases as long as the refCon is unique for each time.

  Your *draw* callback function takes three parameters (phase, after, refCon).
  If *after* is zero, you callback can return 0 to suppress further X-Plane drawing in
  the phase, or 1 to allow X-Plane to finish drawing. (Return value is ignored when
  *after* is 1.)

  >>> def MyDraw(phase, after, refCon):
  ...    xp.setGraphicsState(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
  ...    xp.drawString([.9, 0, 0], 110, 175, "Hello there", None, xp.Font_Basic)
  ...
  >>> xp.registerDrawCallback(MyDraw)
  1

  .. image:: /images/display_drawstring.png
             
  >>> xp.unregisterDrawCallback(MyDraw)
  1

  If you have installed python opengl:

  >>> import OpenGL.GL as GL
  >>> def MyGLDraw(phase, after, refCon):
  ...    xp.setGraphicsState(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
  ...    left, top, right, bottom = 100, 200, 200, 100
  ...    numLines = int(min(top - bottom, right - left) / 2)
  ...    time = int(numLines * xp.getElapsedTime()) % numLines
  ...    for i in range(numLines):
  ...         GL.glBegin(GL.GL_LINE_LOOP)
  ...         left += 1
  ...         right -= 1
  ...         bottom += 1
  ...         top -= 1
  ...         x = (i + time) % numLines
  ...         GL.glColor3f(x / numLines, (numLines - x) / numLines, x / numLines)  # change colors, for fun
  ...         GL.glVertex2f(left, bottom)
  ...         GL.glVertex2f(left, top)
  ...         GL.glVertex2f(right, top)
  ...         GL.glVertex2f(right, bottom)
  ...         GL.glEnd()
  ...
  >>> xp.registerDrawCallback(MyGLDraw)
  1

  .. image:: /images/display_opengl.png
             
  >>> xp.unregisterDrawCallback(MyGLDraw)
  1

  Upon entry to your callback, the OpenGL context will be correctly set up for you and OpenGL
  will be in 'local' coordinates for 3d drawing and panel coordinates for 2d
  drawing.  The OpenGL state (texturing, etc.) will be unknown.

  **Drawing Phases**

    *phase* indicates which part of drawing we are in.  Drawing is done
    from the back to the front.  We get a callback before or after each item.
    Metaphases provide access to the beginning and end of the 3d (scene) and 2d
    (cockpit) drawing in a manner that is independent of new phases added via
    x-plane implementation.
    
     .. warning:: As X-Plane's scenery evolves, some drawing phases may cease to
       exist and new ones may be invented. If you need a particularly specific
       use of these codes, consult Austin and/or be prepared to revise your code
       as X-Plane evolves.

  This may seem obvious, but it bears repeating: *Make your draw code fast*. It will be executed thousands of times
  and every microsecond wasted will impact the user's frame rate (FPS). See, for example, demo code in plugin
  :doc:`PI_TextureDraw.py </development/samples>`. A simple port from C to Python results in horrid execution times.
  A benefit of writing in C/C++ is the compiler is able to optimize execution. By changing some simple python code
  to use python's ``numpy`` module, we were able to speed up draw times by a factor of 36 (from 65 milliseconds
  per frame to 1.8 msec!).

.. py:function:: unregisterDrawCallback(draw, phase=Phase_Window, after=1, refCon=None)
 
  Unregister a low level drawing callback. Parameters must match those provided with
  :py:func:`registerDrawCallback`.
 
  You must unregister a callback for each time you register, if
  you have registered it multiple times with different refCons.

  Returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise.
