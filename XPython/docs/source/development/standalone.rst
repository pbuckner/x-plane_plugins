Standalone Python
-----------------

In addition to plugins, X-Plane supports external communications via UDP. This
allows any number of separate processes (potentially on separate computers) to
get and set data remotely and execute some commands.

This is *completely* unrelated to XPPython3, but as you're programming in python
I figured I might as well introduce you to this method of interaction as well.
