XPPython3 Version 4
===================

XPPython3 [#why]_ is a plugin for Laminar Research `X-Plane <https://www.x-plane.com>`_. It supports writing
of additional plugins using python3. This is a replacement for Sandy Barbour's excellent
`PythonInterface <http://www.xpluginsdk.org/python_interface.htm>`_ plugin, which supported only python2.

Curious? See `current usage graphs <https://maps.avnwx.com/x-plane/stats>`_.

This is XPPython3 version 4.

* **X-Plane 12**

* **Python3 only**: Python3.12 is recommended. Note that you will have to use the correct version of this
  plugin to match the version of python installed on your system. We currently support python3.10, python3.11, and python3.12.

.. note::

   For **X-Plane 11** or other versions of python, you must use an earlier
   version of this plugin: `XPPython3 Version 3.1.5 <https://xppython3.rtfd.io/en/3.1.5/>`_.

See :doc:`usage/installation_plugin` to install the plugin.

See :doc:`development/index` to write your own python plugins.

:doc:`changelog` lists current and previous versions.

.. [#why]             
    It's called XPPython3:

    1. "xpython" already exists (it's an all python version of python)

    2. "3" to emphasize it is python3, which is not fully backward compatible with python2.
