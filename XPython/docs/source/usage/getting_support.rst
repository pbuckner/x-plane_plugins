Getting Support
===============

Include:

#. Name of the plugin you're trying to use, (e.g., PI_foobar.py)
#. Copy of ``Log.txt`` (which tells us most everything about your X-Plane installation)
#. Copy of ``XPPython3Log.txt`` (which tells us most everything about your Python installation). This log is found
   in the same folder as Log.txt.

Describe what you're seeing versus what you're expecting to see... "It's broken" is *not* useful.

Provide that information to `x-plane.org/forums <https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/forum/630-python-development/>`_
or `email support <mailto:support@xppython3.org?body=What%20happened%3F%0A%0AWhat%20did%20you%20expect%20to%20happen%3F%0A%0AWhich%20python%20plugin%28s%29%20are%20you%20using%3F%0A%0AAttach%20Log.txt%20and%20XPPython3Log.txt>`_. Information is available from the *About* XPPython3 menu.

You should provide both **Log.txt** and **XPPython3Log.txt** when looking for assistance with a python plugin.

.. Warning:: It is **very** unlikely that a python2 plugin will work without modification with python3. The
             python language itself changed between versions. Additionally, python2 plugins used older
             X-Plane APIs, some of which have been retired with X-Plane 11.50+.

             If you have questions about a particular python plugin, please contact the plugin's creator!
