# Previous Releases

In case of emergency, here are the downloadable zip files for previous releases.

You should always be able to revert to a previous release (assuming OS, Python, and X-Plane compatibility) by:

 1. Remove existing \<X-Plane\>/Resources/plugins/XPPython3
  
 2. Download and extract ZIP file for desired release, matching your version of Python.
 
 3. Extract XPPython3 to \<X-Plane\>/Resources/plugins/, so you have a new (old) directory there called XPPython3.

Restart X-Plane.
