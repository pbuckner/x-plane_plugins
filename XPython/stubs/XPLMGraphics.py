"""Graphics routines for X-Plane and OpenGL.

 A few notes on coordinate systems:

 X-Plane uses three kinds of coordinates.  Global coordinates are specified
 as latitude, longitude and elevation.  This coordinate system never changes
 but is not very precise.

 OpenGL (or 'local') coordinates are cartesian and shift with the plane.
 They offer more precision and are used for 3-d OpenGL drawing.  The X axis
 is aligned east-west with positive X meaning east.  The Y axis is aligned
 straight up and down at the point 0,0,0 (but since the earth is round it is
 not truly straight up and down at other points).  The Z axis is aligned
 north-south at 0, 0, 0 with positive Z pointing south (but since the earth
 is round it isn't exactly north-south as you move east or west of 0, 0, 0).
 One unit is one meter and the point 0,0,0 is on the surface of the  earth
 at sea level for some latitude and longitude picked by the sim such that
 the  user's aircraft is reasonably nearby.

 Cockpit coordinates are 2d, with the X axis horizontal and the Y axis
 vertical. The point 0,0 is the bottom left and 1024,768 is the upper right
 of the screen. This is true no matter what resolution the user's monitor is
 in; when running in higher resolution, graphics will be scaled.

 Use X-Plane's routines to convert between global and local coordinates.  Do
 not attempt to do this conversion yourself; the precise 'roundness' of
 X-Plane's  physics model may not match your own, and (to make things
 weirder) the user can potentially customize the physics of the current
 planet.


 XPLM Texture IDs name well-known textures in the sim for you to use. This
 allows you to recycle textures from X-Plane, saving VRAM.

   xplm_Tex_GeneralInterface
     - The bitmap that contains window outlines, button outlines, fonts, etc.

   xplm_Tex_AircraftPaint
     - The exterior paint for the user's aircraft (daytime).

   xplm_Tex_AircraftLiteMap
     - The exterior light map for the user's aircraft.



 X-Plane features some fixed-character fonts.  Each font may have its own
 metrics.

 WARNING: Some of these fonts are no longer supported or may have changed
 geometries. For maximum copmatibility, see the comments below.

 Note: X-Plane 7 supports proportional-spaced fonts.  Since no measuring
 routine is available yet, the SDK will normally draw using a fixed-width
 font.  You can use a dataref to enable proportional font drawing on XP7 if
 you want to.

   xplmFont_Basic
     - Mono-spaced font for user interface.  Available in all versions of the SDK.

   xplmFont_Proportional
     - Proportional UI font.

      inEnableAlphaTesting  - integer
      inEnableAlphaBlending - integer
      inEnableDepthTesting  - integer
      inEnableDepthWriting  - integer

   XPLMSetGraphicsState changes OpenGL's graphics state in a number of ways:

   inEnableFog - enables or disables fog, equivalent to: glEnable(GL_FOG);

   inNumberTexUnits - enables or disables a number of multitexturing units. If
   the number is 0, 2d texturing is disabled entirely, as in
   glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);  Otherwise, 2d texturing is enabled, and  a
   number of multitexturing units are enabled sequentially, starting  with
   unit 0, e.g. glActiveTextureARB(GL_TEXTURE0_ARB);  glEnable
   (GL_TEXTURE_2D);

   inEnableLighting - enables or disables OpenGL lighting, e.g.
   glEnable(GL_LIGHTING); glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);

   inEnableAlphaTesting - enables or disables the alpha test per pixel, e.g.
   glEnable(GL_ALPHA_TEST);

   inEnableAlphaBlending - enables or disables alpha blending per pixel, e.g.
   glEnable(GL_BLEND);

   inEnableDepthTesting - enables per pixel depth testing, as in
   glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);

   inEnableDepthWriting - enables writing back of depth information to the
   depth bufffer, as in glDepthMask(GL_TRUE);

   The purpose of this function is to change OpenGL state while keeping
   X-Plane aware of the state changes; this keeps X-Plane from getting
   surprised by OGL state changes, and prevents X-Plane and plug-ins from
   having to set all state before all draws; XPLMSetGraphicsState internally
   skips calls to change state that is already properly enabled.

   X-Plane does not have a 'default' OGL state to plug-ins; plug-ins should
   totally set OGL state before drawing.  Use XPLMSetGraphicsState instead of
   any of the above OpenGL calls.

   WARNING: Any routine that performs drawing (e.g. XPLMDrawString or widget
   code) may change X-Plane's state.  Always set state before drawing after
   unknown code has executed.

   XPLMBindTexture2d changes what texture is bound to the 2d texturing target.
   This routine caches the current 2d texture across all texturing units in
   the sim and plug-ins, preventing extraneous binding.  For example, consider
   several plug-ins running in series; if they all use the 'general interface'
   bitmap to do UI, calling this function will skip the rebinding of the
   general interface texture on all but the first plug-in, which can provide
   better frame rate son some graphics cards.

   inTextureID is the ID of the texture object to bind; inTextureUnit is a
   zero-based  texture unit (e.g. 0 for the first one), up to a maximum of 4
